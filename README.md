# Summary

This a full-stack project made with the MVC Architecture Pattern, PHP, SCSS and Active Record. Its purpose was to create an App with an easy and intuitive management of appointments with a complete CRUD system for a Beauty Salon Administrator and for the clients, who can assign themselves (within the limits stablished) new appointments if they are registered and confirmed via E-mail and Token. 
Both sides of the App are protected and restricted the access depending of the permissions assigned via the Database Administrator.


## Client Side - Creating a New Appointment

Therefore, the APP has a Sign-up and Login system with their respective form validations for the new users:
